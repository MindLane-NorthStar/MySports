# The queue — real work that has not started

**What this is.** A briefing for someone who has not read the conversation that produced it: each
entry says what the work is, why it matters, where in the tree it starts, and roughly how big it is.
**It is not a TODO list and nothing here is approved** — an entry is a description of a problem, and
the decision to take it on is Joe's. Filed by prompt 87 on 2026-09-10; every entry was checked against
the tree or the database that day, and says so where the evidence is a measurement.

**Working rule 30 applies with force:** every "missing", "not started" or "no X" below is a
timestamp. Check the thing itself before acting on an entry, and correct the entry in the same commit
as the work.

`docs/handoff-status.md` stays the authority for state, gates and open items; this file only holds
work that is understood and not begun. When an entry is taken, delete it here and record the work
there.

## 1. ESPN deep links

**What.** Make ESPN watch links open the ESPN app on the game rather than a web page.
`docs/research/universal-links-aasa-2026-09-07.md` records what 23 services claim in their
apple-app-site-association files: `www.espn.com` claims `/*/game/_/gameId/*` and the database holds
those ids, but there is **no general `/watch` claim**, so the ceiling is the app opened on the game,
not on a stream.

**Why it is easier now.** On 2026-09-10 Joe tapped the MLB.TV link from inside the installed app and
the MLB app opened (`docs/research/mlb-tv-tap-test.md`): a `target="_blank"` link from the PWA does
hand off to a claimed app. That was the open risk.

**Where it starts.** `web/lib/config.js`'s `WATCH` map and `watchUrl()`, and `WatchLink` in
`web/components/GameDetail.js`. Prompt 81's MLB.TV work (`mlbAppUrl`) is the pattern.
`handoff-status.md`'s two `### OPEN — THE STREAMING…` entries carry the same item.

**Size.** Medium, and it ends in a tap on Joe's phone that no gate can stand in for.

## 2. The watch-link audit table, for Joe's eye

**What.** `docs/research/watch-links-2026-09-09.md` — the 34 hand-maintained watch URLs, checked.
It needs a human pass: a URL that answers 200 can still point at the wrong thing (prompt 76 found a
station link that returned a clean 200 for a different station).

**Size.** Joe's reading time; any fix is a line in `web/lib/config.js`.

## 3. Three MLB rows stuck at `scheduled` while carrying a link

**What.** `mlb-823908`, `mlb-823984`, `mlb-825038` — all viewing day 2026-09-01, kickoffs 21:38–22:10
ET, `result_status = 'scheduled'`, game link stored. Confirmed 2026-09-10. They were in progress when a
loader run wrote the link and the status never advanced; the nightly MLB step only covers yesterday
onward, so nothing will revisit them.

**Size.** Three rows out of ~3,950; a data oddity, not a code defect. Fixing it is a database write:
rule 14 (named approval), rule 6 (SELECT and paste first), and the adapter's own finals for that date
are the source — not a hand-typed score.

## 4. `boxscore_url` is now a misleading column name

**What.** Since prompt 86 it holds a PREVIEW URL before kickoff (the app labels it Preview, Live box
score, Box score). Renaming it — to something like `game_url` — reaches `web/lib/queries.js:25`, the
PostgREST select list, `pipeline/load.py`'s `SCORES_SQL` and `boxscore_url()`, migrations 0018/0019,
`web/scripts/smoke.mjs` and every test that names the field. Deliberately deferred from prompt 86 so
one block did not have three candidate causes; register §35c.

**Size.** Medium: a migration (rename, applied from the file on named approval), a coordinated code
change, and a deploy ordered so the app never selects a column that does not exist.

## 5. Monday Night Countdown's two corrections

**What.** ESPN's release (register §35b) gives Monday Night Countdown an NFL Network simulcast and a
stated 6–8 p.m. window; `data/studio_shows.json` has `simulcast: null` and `duration_min: null` for
`mnfcountdown`. **Left alone on purpose** — the bookend rule currently produces a correct show from the
default and its anchor. Taking it means a simulcast broadcast row and a duration that no longer comes
from the default.

**Size.** Small data change through the parser (rule 17), plus the loader run.

## 6. The hard-coded end dates in the nightly

**What.** `schedule_refresh.yml` generates studio shows `--through 2026-12-31` (`:226`, `:231`) while
the registry's NFL shows run to `active_to: 2027-01-03` and Monday Night Countdown to `2027-01-04` — so
the last Sunday and Monday of the regular season are missing for every NFL studio show. WWE (`:169`)
and AEW (`:188`) carry the same `2026-12-31` cliff, and NASCAR (`:115`), IndyCar (`:154`) and UFC
(`:203`) are pinned to `--year 2026`. Every one of them silently stops producing rows on 1 January.

**Size.** Small per step; the design question is whether the horizon should be computed (today + N
days) rather than typed.

## 7. Building the schedule out to April 2027

**What.** Joe's stated goal: a calendar that reaches the end of the NBA and NHL regular seasons.
**The vehicle exists** — `.github/workflows/bootstrap_season.yml` takes `nfl_weeks`, `nhl_from` /
`nhl_to` and `nba_from` / `nba_to` (`:9-15`). Three things to settle first:

- **The nightly's forward horizon is a week at most for every sport**, so a season loaded once goes
  stale on reschedules unless something re-reads it.
- **Schedule and broadcast are different problems.** NBA and NHL publish full seasons, but national TV
  assignments cover only part of them and the NFL flexes windows on ~12 days' notice, so most of a
  season-long calendar would carry no channel and render "Not yet confirmed" (the NETWORK TBD state,
  `05-home-page-decisions.md` §9). That is correct behaviour, and a lot of it.
- **UFC cannot be built that far at all**: the source announces cards 8–12 weeks out.

**Size.** Large, and mostly decisions.
