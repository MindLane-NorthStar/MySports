# Mobile Grid Addendum — v1.0 (decided 2026-09-02)

**Scope: EVERY grid rendering in EVERY mobile view, for EVERY sport** — CFB, NFL, MLB, NBA, NHL, and any future sport — in the Today, Weeks, and History views alike. The PC/archival grid remains governed by `docs/rendering-contract.md` unamended; anything not listed below inherits that contract verbatim on mobile too.

**M1. Presentation scale.** All grid content renders at 80% of contract design size (the 10px call letters cross the ~8px legibility floor below 80%).

**M2. Time scale — per-day maximum compression.** Per day, per sport: minimum standard-block width = (widest rendered team line on the slate, including rank prefix and record run, measured in the real fonts) + 2×CAP (148) + 34; `PX = that width ÷ the sport's standard display duration` (CFB/NFL 210 min; MLB/NBA/NHL per render policy). Nothing is ever pushed to an additional line — by construction. Shorter truncated blocks keep the contract fit rules (shrink-keep-record → drop record → shrink name → abbreviation).

**M3. Gap collapse — hard cut.** A stretch ≥60 min with no game airing (start → start + sport's estimated duration) is cut: thin dashed seam labeled with the skipped range ("no games 5:15 – 6:40"); axis resumes at the next window. Continuous days render uncut.

**M4. Network rail — fixed, narrowed inside.** Rail 69pt (86 design px at 80%). Tile height unchanged; the mark shrinks inside, fit-boxed; the 10px call-letters band unchanged. Accepted: fine print on detail badges (SEC Network, FS1, ACCN, B1G) is soft-but-identifiable. The rail is permanently fixed left on the grid screen — panning moves only the schedule — and stays pinned at every pinch-zoom level (scaling with zoom).

**M5. Axis labels — hour-only shorthand, Style B, MOBILE ONLY.** Labels only on the hour: Noon, 1pm … 11pm, Midnight, 1am. Style B: Barlow Condensed 700 ~17px design, gold #F0C850, UPPERCASE (NOON · 1PM), letter-spacing 1.2. Gridlines and block placement keep :15 granularity; exact kickoffs stay in card trays. PC/archival keeps v1.2 block-start/end labels.

**M6. Pinch-to-zoom.** Enabled; rail pinned per M4.

**M7. TBD section.** Cards scale to viewport width; card fit rules absorb shrink. Grouping/ordering/tray unchanged.

**M8. Streaming-group rows.** Full size, lanes never capped; a jump-to-network quick-nav row is added.

**M9. Header/legend/footer.** The contract's narrow-day stacking rule is the mobile default; footer pills wrap; the omitted-games pill is never dropped.

**M10. Empty rows.** Omitted — identical to contract §2.

**M11. Interaction.** Tap block → game detail panel (broadcast list w/ access, odds, records, venue, best-effort deep link to the carrying service / DirecTV Stream); finals → box-score link per history rules. Near-live 15-minute refresh during game windows.

**M12. Team logos — two contexts (app-wide).** On cap endcaps and light tint plates: RAW, never lightness-adjusted (contract v1.3e). Floating on charcoal (listings, odds slot): the derive + lightness-floor chain. Network marks use the locked per-network recipe table + frozen ink-area normalization in card contexts; the rail keeps derive_dark_mark.

**M13. Everything else** — block anatomy, cap gradients (tint 0.86→0.58), centered names with rank + record run, hairlines, seam gradient, pills tray with drop priority, marquee gold plate, ALT pills, eligibility buckets, row order, legend glyphs — identical to the PC contract. No other mobile deviations exist.
